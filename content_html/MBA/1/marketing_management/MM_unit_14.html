    <h1>UNIT 14: MARKETING MANAGEMENT: ETHICAL AND SOCIAL DIMENSIONS</h1>
    <div class="case-study">
        <p><strong>Contextual Example:</strong> We will use Global Harvest Foods (GHF), a large multinational corporation that produces packaged snacks, processed foods, and beverages, to illustrate ethical dilemmas and social responsibilities in marketing. GHF faces challenges related to product health, environmental waste, fair labor practices, and advertising aimed at vulnerable populations.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>1. IMPORTANCE OF MARKETING ETHICS</h2>
        <p><strong>Marketing Ethics</strong> are the moral principles and values that guide marketing decisions and behavior. They are the rules and standards a company must adhere to, beyond legal requirements, to ensure fairness and integrity.</p>
        <h4>Importance:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Building Trust and Reputation:</strong> Ethical behavior fosters long-term customer trust, which is GHF's most valuable asset. Unethical practices (e.g., misleading labeling) can instantly destroy reputation.</li>
            <li><strong>Customer Loyalty:</strong> Customers, especially in developed markets, increasingly favor brands perceived as ethical and socially responsible, leading to greater loyalty and willingness to pay a premium.</li>
            <li><strong>Avoiding Legal Scrutiny:</strong> Adopting high ethical standards proactively minimizes the risk of lawsuits, regulatory fines, and public relations crises.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="example">
            <p><strong>GHF Example:</strong> GHF must decide whether to stop marketing sugary breakfast cereals directly to children, even though it's legal, because it aligns with a higher ethical standard of promoting public health.</p>

        <h2>2. SOCIAL IMPACT OF MARKETING</h2>
        <p>Marketing decisions have widespread consequences, affecting individuals, society, and competitors.</p>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2.1 Individual Customer</h3>
            <p>Marketing practices can harm individual consumers in several ways:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>High Prices:</strong> Excessive markups or non-transparent pricing.</li>
                <li><strong>Deceptive Practices:</strong> Misrepresenting a product's features, price, or history (e.g., "all-natural" labeling on highly processed food).
                    <div class="example">
                        <p><strong>GHF Example:</strong> Using misleading health claims on a snack food package, such as emphasizing a minor vitamin addition while downplaying high sugar or saturated fat content.</p>
                    </div>
                </li>
                <li><strong>High-Pressure Selling:</strong> Pushing customers to buy products they don't need or can't afford.</li>
                <li><strong>Unsafe Products:</strong> Failing to ensure adequate product safety and quality before launch.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2.2 Society</h3>
