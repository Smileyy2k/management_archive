    <h1>UNIT 4: STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS IN MARKETING</h1>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>1. DEFINING STRATEGIC MARKET PLANNING</h2>
        <p><strong>Strategic market planning</strong> is the process of creating a long-term roadmap for a business to achieve its marketing goals by aligning them with its overall business objectives. It involves analyzing the market and competitive landscape to make informed decisions about the marketing mix.</p>
        
        <h4>Importance of Strategic Market Planning:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Provides a Clear Direction:</strong> Acts as a roadmap, ensuring all marketing activities are aligned with the company's vision.</li>
            <li><strong>Enhances Competitive Advantage:</strong> By analyzing competitors, a firm can identify its unique strengths and create a powerful value proposition.</li>
            <li><strong>Optimizes Resource Allocation:</strong> Forces a company to prioritize efforts and allocate resources to the most impactful activities.</li>
            <li><strong>Promotes Proactive Decision-Making:</strong> Allows a company to anticipate future trends and challenges rather than just reacting to them.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>2. CORPORATE AND DIVISIONAL STRATEGIC PLANNING</h2>
        <p>This multi-level process guides a company's growth and resource allocation, starting from a broad corporate vision.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Corporate Mission:</strong> Defines the company's purpose, values, and direction.</li>
            <li><strong>Establishment of SBUs (Strategic Business Units):</strong> A large company is broken down into units that operate like separate businesses, each with its own mission and competitors.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Allocation to SBUs:</strong> Corporate headquarters decides how to allocate resources among SBUs, often using tools like the BCG Matrix or the GE 9-Cell Grid.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>3.1 BCG Competitive Advantage Matrix</h4>
            <p>The Boston Consulting Group (BCG) matrix classifies SBUs based on market growth rate and relative market share into four categories:</p>
            <div class="format-example">
                            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stars:</strong> High market share, high growth rate. Require significant investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Cash Cows:</strong> High market share, low growth rate. Mature, profitable businesses that generate surplus cash.</li>
                <li><strong>Question Marks:</strong> Low market share, high growth rate. New ventures with uncertain futures that require heavy investment.</li>
                <li><strong>Dogs:</strong> Low market share, low growth rate. Often generate only enough cash to maintain themselves and may be divested.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Planning New Business and Downsizing</h4>
            <p>Companies must have strategies for both growth and managing underperforming units.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Intensive Growth:</strong> Growing the core business through market penetration, market development, or product development.</li>
                <li><strong>Integrative Growth:</strong> Acquiring or merging with other businesses in the industry (backward, forward, or horizontal integration).</li>
                <li><strong>Diversification Growth:</strong> Pursuing opportunities outside the current business lines.</li>
                <li><strong>Downsizing Older Businesses:</strong> Strategically eliminating or reducing a business unit that is no longer profitable through divestment, harvesting, or liquidation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
