    <h1>UNIT 7: MARKET SEGMENTATION AND MARKET TARGETING</h1>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>1. MARKET SEGMENTATION AND MARKET TARGETING</h2>
        <p><strong>Market segmentation</strong> is the process of dividing a broad market into sub-groups of consumers (segments) based on shared characteristics. <strong>Market targeting</strong> then involves evaluating each segment's attractiveness and selecting one or more segments to serve. This allows companies to focus their resources and develop tailored marketing mixes.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>2. NEED FOR SEGMENTING MARKETS</h2>
        <p>Segmentation is essential for several key reasons:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Consumer Heterogeneity:</strong> Consumers' needs and preferences vary widely. A single product cannot satisfy everyone.</li>
            <li><strong>Resource Optimization:</strong> Companies have limited resources. Segmentation allows them to focus their marketing budget on groups most likely to respond, maximizing ROI.</li>
            <li><strong>Competitive Advantage:</strong> By serving a specific segment (a niche), a company can create a strong, defensible position in the market.</li>
            <li><strong>Improved Customer Understanding:</strong> The process forces companies to deeply analyze their customers, leading to products that precisely meet their needs and build loyalty.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>3. MARKET SEGMENTATION LEVELS</h2>
        <p>Markets can be segmented at different levels of specificity:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Segment Marketing:</strong> A company identifies a large, identifiable group with similar needs (e.g., an airline offering business class for travelers valuing comfort and economy class for those prioritizing affordability).</li>
            <li><strong>Individual Marketing:</strong> Customizing products and marketing for a single customer, also known as "one-to-one marketing" (e.g., Netflix recommending content based on viewing history).</li>
            <li><strong>Niche Marketing:</strong> Focusing on a more narrowly defined group seeking a distinct set of benefits (e.g., a company selling only specialized rock climbing equipment).</li>
            <li><strong>Local Marketing:</strong> Tailoring marketing to the needs of local customer groups in specific geographical areas (e.g., a retail chain selling beachwear in coastal cities).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>4. SELECTION OF SEGMENTATION VARIABLES</h2>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4.1 Criteria for Segmenting Consumer Market</h3>
            <p>Consumer markets can be segmented using a wide range of variables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Geographic:</strong> Dividing the market into units like nations, states, or cities.</li>
                <li><strong>Demographic:</strong> Based on variables like age, gender, income, occupation, and social class.</li>
                <li><strong>Psychographic:</strong> Based on lifestyle, personality, and values (e.g., targeting consumers with an active, health-conscious lifestyle).</li>
                <li><strong>Behavioral:</strong> Based on their knowledge of, attitude toward, use of, or response to a product. This includes:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Occasions:</strong> Marketing for specific occasions like Valentine's Day.</li>
                        <li><strong>Benefits:</strong> Targeting specific benefits like whitening or cavity-fighting toothpaste.</li>

                        <li><strong>Loyalty Status:</strong> Hard-core loyals, split loyals, shifting loyals, and switchers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4.2 Criteria for Segmenting Organizational Markets</h3>
            <p>Organizational markets are segmented using business-specific variables:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Demographics:</strong> Industry, company size, and customer location.</li>
                <li><strong>Operating Variables:</strong> Company technology, product use status, and customer capabilities.</li>
                <li><strong>Purchasing Approaches:</strong> Organization's purchasing function, power structures, and general purchasing policies.</li>
                <li><strong>Situational Factors:</strong> Urgency of order, product application, and size of the order.</li>
                <li><strong>Personal Characteristics:</strong> The individual preferences and relationships of the buyers.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>5. EFFECTIVE SEGMENTATION</h2>
        <p>For a market segment to be useful, it must be:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> The size, purchasing power, and characteristics must be quantifiable.</li>
            <li><strong>Substantial:</strong> The segment must be large and profitable enough to serve.</li>
            <li><strong>Accessible:</strong> The segment must be effectively reachable with marketing efforts.</li>
            <li><strong>Differentiable:</strong> Segments must be conceptually distinguishable and respond differently to marketing mixes.</li>
            <li><strong>Actionable:</strong> The company must have the resources to design and implement effective programs for the segment.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>6. TARGET MARKET SELECTION PROCESS</h2>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>6.1 Evaluating the Market Segments</h3>
            <p>A company evaluates segments based on two main factors:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Segment Attractiveness:</strong> The size, growth, profitability, and low risk of a segment.</li>
                <li><strong>Company Objectives and Resources:</strong> The segment must align with the company's long-term goals and capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>6.2 Selecting the Market Segments</h3>
            <p>A company can choose from five patterns for selection:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Single Segment Concentration:</strong> The company focuses on a single segment, becoming a specialist.</li>
                <li><strong>Selective Specialization:</strong> The company selects a number of attractive segments that fit its objectives.</li>
                <li><strong>Product Specialization:</strong> The company focuses on making a specific product and sells it to several different segments.</li>
                <li><strong>Market Specialization:</strong> The company focuses on serving the needs of a particular customer group with a variety of products.</li>
                <li><strong>Full Market Coverage:</strong> The company attempts to serve all customer groups with all the products they might need.</li>
            </ol>
