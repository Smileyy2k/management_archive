    <h1>UNIT 13: DIRECT AND ONLINE MARKETING</h1>
    <div class="case-study">
        <p><strong>Contextual Example:</strong> We will use the example of Aroma Craft Coffee, a niche retailer that sources rare, single-origin coffee beans. Aroma Craft bypasses traditional retail channels, relying heavily on Direct Marketing methods. Their business model is built on using customer data to personalize offers, build strong relationships, and maximize repeat purchases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>1. NATURE AND SCOPE OF DIRECT MARKETING</h2>
        <p><strong>Direct Marketing</strong> is a targeted system of marketing that uses one or more advertising media to effect a measurable response and/or transaction at any location. The core distinction is the emphasis on a specific, measurable call-to-action (e.g., "Buy now," "Click here").</p>
        <h4>Key Characteristics:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Targeted:</strong> Focuses on a defined customer or segment using data.</li>
            <li><strong>Measurable:</strong> Every campaign's success is tracked.</li>
            <li><strong>Action-Oriented:</strong> Designed to elicit an immediate behavioral response.</li>
            <li><strong>Relational:</strong> Used to build long-term, one-to-one customer relationships.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>2. GROWTH AND BENEFITS OF DIRECT MARKETING</h2>
        <p>The growth of direct marketing is driven by technological advancements, database sophistication, credit card usage, and market fragmentation. Its key benefits include precise targeting, measurability, flexibility, and relationship building.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>3. DATABASE MARKETING</h2>
        <p><strong>Database Marketing</strong> is the process of building, maintaining, and using customer databases for the purposes of contacting, transacting, and building customer relationships. A marketing database includes purchase history, demographics, and response patterns.</p>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>The RFM Model</h3>
            <p>A common method for ranking customers for direct marketing is the RFM Model:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>R - Recency:</strong> How recently the customer made a purchase.</li>
                <li><strong>F - Frequency:</strong> How often the customer purchases.</li>
                <li><strong>M- Monetary Value:</strong> How much the customer spends.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="example">
                <p><strong>Aroma Craft Example:</strong> The database identifies RFM Score "555" customers (highest tier). When a new, ultra-exclusive bean arrives, Aroma Craft targets only these 555 customers via a personalized text message, maximizing the chance of a sale with minimal cost.</p>
            </div>

            <li><strong>Telemarketing:</strong> Using the telephone to sell directly, either through outbound calls or inbound toll-free numbers.</li>
            <li><strong>Kiosk Marketing:</strong> Using automated information and ordering machines in high-traffic locations.</li>
            <li><strong>Home Shopping:</strong> Direct selling via dedicated television channels (infomercials).</li>
            <li><strong>Other Media:</strong> Traditional direct-response formats like TV, radio, and magazines that include a specific call-to-action.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
