    <h1>UNIT 9: MARKETING AND COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES</h1>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>1. CONCEPT OF COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE</h2>
        <p><strong>Competitive advantage</strong> is the superiority a firm achieves over its rivals, providing higher customer value, either through lower prices or by offering greater benefits that justify higher prices. A competitive advantage must be customer-focused, sustainable, and measurable.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>2. PORTER'S FIVE FORCES MODEL</h2>
        <p>Michael Porter's Five Forces Model is a framework for analyzing industry structure and determining the level of competition and long-term profitability. The five forces determine the industry's overall attractiveness.</p>
        <div class="format-example">
                    </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Barriers to Entry/Threat of New Entrants:</strong> This determines how easily new competitors can enter the market. High barriers (e.g., large capital requirements, strong brand loyalty) protect existing firms.</li>
            <li><strong>Intensity of Rivalry among Firms:</strong> This describes the extent of competition within the industry. High rivalry drives down prices and profitability.</li>
            <li><strong>Threat of Substitutes:</strong> Substitutes are products from different industries that satisfy the same need (e.g., train vs. airline travel). A high threat limits pricing power.</li>
            <li><strong>Bargaining Power of Buyers:</strong> This refers to the pressure customers can exert to lower prices. Power is high when buyers are few but large or when products are undifferentiated.</li>
            <li><strong>Bargaining Power of Suppliers:</strong> This is the ability of suppliers to raise input prices. Power is high when the supply industry is dominated by a few large companies or inputs are critical.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>3. ANALYSIS OF COMPETITORS</h2>
        <p>Competitor analysis involves identifying key competitors, assessing their objectives, strategies, strengths, and weaknesses, and anticipating their reactions.</p>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>3.1 Classes of Competitors</h3>
            <p>Competitors can be classified by the level of substitutability:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Brand Competition:</strong> The most direct form, between companies offering similar products to the same target market (e.g., Coca-Cola vs. Pepsi).</li>
                <li><strong>Industry Competition:</strong> Rivalry between all companies in the same product class (e.g., all automobile manufacturers).</li>
                <li><strong>Form Competition:</strong> Rivalry between products that satisfy the same basic need in different forms (e.g., cars vs. public transport).</li>
                <li><strong>Generic Competition:</strong> Rivalry for the same disposable income (e.g., choosing between a new car and a luxury vacation).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>3.4 Reaction Patterns</h3>
            <p>Understanding a competitor's typical reaction helps in strategy design:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>The Relaxed Competitor:</strong> Does not react quickly or strongly.</li>
                <li><strong>The Selective Competitor:</strong> Reacts only to certain types of attacks (e.g., price cuts).</li>
                <li><strong>The Tiger Competitor:</strong> Reacts swiftly and strongly to any attack.</li>
                <li><strong>The Stochastic/Unpredictable Competitor:</strong> Does not exhibit a predictable reaction pattern.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>4. PORTER'S GENERIC COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES</h2>
        <p>These strategies outline how a company can achieve competitive advantage in its chosen scope (broad or narrow market).</p>
        <div class="format-example">
                    </div>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost Leadership Strategy:</strong> The company works to achieve the lowest production and distribution costs to price lower than competitors and win a large market share.</li>
            <li><strong>Differentiation Strategy:</strong> The company focuses on creating a highly differentiated product and marketing program to become the class leader, often commanding a premium price.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus Strategy:</strong> The company focuses on serving one or a few narrow market segments (niches). This can take the form of <strong>Cost Focus</strong> or <strong>Differentiation Focus</strong>.</li>
        </ul>
        <div class="info-box">
            <p>Companies that fail to pursue a clear strategy risk being "<strong>Stuck in the Middle,</strong>" lacking both a cost advantage and distinctiveness.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>5. DESIGNING COMPETITIVE STRATEGIES (ROLE-BASED)</h2>
        <p>Firms can be classified into four roles: Market Leader, Market Challenger, Market Follower, or Market Nicher.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Market Leader Strategies:</strong> The firm with the largest market share focuses on expanding the total market, protecting its current share, and expanding its share.</li>
            <li><strong>Market Challenger Strategies:</strong> The second-largest firm aggressively challenges the leader using strategies like a <strong>frontal attack</strong> (matching the leader), a <strong>flank attack</strong> (attacking weaknesses), or a <strong>bypass attack</strong> (leapfrogging the leader with new technology).</li>
            <li><strong>Market Follower Strategies:</strong> Firms that choose not to "rock the boat," often imitating the leader's products. They can be a <strong>cloner</strong> (emulates), <strong>imitator</strong> (copies with some differentiation), or <strong>adapter</strong> (improves on the leader's product).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>6. COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEM</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Competitive Intelligence (CI)</strong> system is a set of procedures designed to systematically gather, analyze, and distribute timely information about the industry and competitors. The process involves setting up the system, data collection from primary and secondary sources, analysis of the data, and communication of insights to decision-makers.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>7. TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT (TQM)</h2>
        <p><strong>Total Quality Management (TQM)</strong> is an organizational-wide approach to continuously improving the quality of all processes, products, and services. It is relevant to competitive strategy because it can lead to both a <strong>cost advantage</strong> (by reducing defects and waste) and <strong>differentiation</strong> (through higher product and service quality), ultimately improving customer satisfaction and loyalty.</p>
