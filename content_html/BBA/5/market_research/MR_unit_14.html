    <h1>UNIT 14: BIVARIATE MEASURES OF ASSOCIATION</h1>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>1. INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <p>This unit explores techniques used to examine the relationship between two variables (bivariate analysis) simultaneously. Understanding these relationships is critical for making predictive and causal claims in market research.</p>
        <p><strong>Bivariate Measures of Association</strong> are statistical techniques used to summarize the strength and nature of the relationship between two variables. We want to see if one thing changes when another thing changes. For example: Does a customer's Gender relate to their Loyalty Card Usage?</p>
    </div>

        <h2>2. CROSS TABULATIONS</h2>
        <p><strong>Cross Tabulation</strong> (or contingency table) is a statistical technique used to simultaneously analyze two categorical variables (Nominal or Ordinal data). The results are presented in a matrix format, showing the frequency distribution of one variable within each category of the other. It's like sorting your data into a simple table to see if groups differ.</p>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Coffee Shop Example:</h4>
            <p>We use cross-tabs to see if Loyalty Card Ownership (Yes/No) differs by Gender (Male/Female).</p>
            <table>
                <thead>
                    <tr>
                        <th></th>
                        <th>Owns Loyalty Card (Yes)</th>
                        <th>Does Not Own Card (No)</th>
                        <th>Total</th>
                    </tr>
                </thead>
                <tbody>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Male</strong></td>
                        <td>50</td>
                        <td>70</td>
                        <td>120</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Female</strong></td>
                        <td>80</td>
                        <td>30</td>
                        <td>110</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Total</strong></td>
                        <td>130</td>
                        <td>100</td>
                        <td>230</td>
                    </tr>
                </tbody>
            </table>
            <p><strong>Observation:</strong> Females appear more likely to own a loyalty card than males. The Chi-Square test would confirm if this observed difference is statistically significant.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>3. SCATTER DIAGRAMS</h2>
        <p>A <strong>Scatter Diagram</strong> (or Scatter Plot) is a graphical representation of the relationship between two continuous variables (Interval or Ratio data). Each point on the graph represents a single observation, plotted on an X and Y axis. It's the simplest way to visually check for correlation.</p>
        <div class="example">
             <h4>Coffee Shop Example:</h4>
             <p>We plot Customer Age (X-axis) against Average Weekly Spend (Y-axis). If the dots rise from left to right, there's a positive relationship. If the dots are randomly spread, there's no relationship.</p>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>4. REGRESSION ANALYSIS</h2>
        <p><strong>Regression Analysis</strong> is a powerful statistical technique used to analyze the linear relationship between a dependent variable (the one to be predicted, Y) and one or more independent variables (the predictors, X). It gives you a mathematical equation that allows you to answer the question: "If we change X by one unit, what specific change can we expect in Y?"</p>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Coffee Shop Example:</h4>
            <p>We want to predict Customer Visit Frequency (Y) using the Customer Satisfaction Score (X).</p>
            <p><strong>Result:</strong> If the resulting equation is $Y = 0.5 + 0.8X$, the slope (b=0.8) means that for every 1-point increase in Satisfaction Score (X), we predict a 0.8 increase in Weekly Visit Frequency (Y).</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>5. CORRELATION ANALYSIS</h2>
        <p><strong>Correlation Analysis</strong> measures the degree to which two continuous variables vary together. The result is the Coefficient of Correlation (r), which ranges from -1.0 (perfect negative) to +1.0 (perfect positive). Correlation tells you the strength and direction of the relationship, but it does <strong>not</strong> imply causation or give a prediction formula.</p>
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p><strong>Key Difference from Regression:</strong> Correlation just confirms a strong relationship exists (e.g., r = 0.9). Regression determines the best way to use that relationship for prediction (e.g., $Y = 10 + 5X$).</p>
        </div>

        <h2>6. LINEAR DISCRIMINANT ANALYSIS (LDA)</h2>
        <p><strong>Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)</strong> is a technique whose primary objective is to determine combinations of independent variables that best differentiate between groups defined by a categorical dependent variable. It helps classify customers into groups based on their measured characteristics by creating a weighted equation to determine if a customer belongs to Group 1 (High Loyalty) or Group 2 (Low Loyalty).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>7. AUTOMATIC INTERACTION DETECTOR (AID)</h2>
        <p>The <strong>Automatic Interaction Detector (AID)</strong> is a data analysis technique used to sequentially partition a sample into a series of subgroups that are maximally different with respect to the mean of a dependent variable. It creates an easy-to-understand tree structure by repeatedly asking, "Which factor creates the biggest difference in the average target outcome?"</p>
        <div class="example">
            <h4>Coffee Shop Example:</h4>
            <p>The goal is Average Monthly Spend. AID might first find the most significant difference is based on Age (≤30 vs. >30). It then examines the "Age ≤30" group and finds the next best split is based on Visit Frequency. This segmentation structure instantly tells the marketing team which combinations of factors define the highest-spending and lowest-spending customer groups.</p>
