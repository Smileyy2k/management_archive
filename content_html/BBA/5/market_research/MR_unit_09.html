    <h1>UNIT 9: ATTITUDE MEASUREMENT</h1>
    <p>This unit covers the essential techniques and scales used by market researchers to quantify people's <strong>attitudes</strong>â€”their relatively enduring evaluations, feelings, and behavioral tendencies towards an object, person, or idea.</p>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>1. GENERAL METHODS OF COLLECTING ATTITUDE DATA</h2>
        <p>These are the broad approaches used to gather information about attitudes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-Report (or Verbal Report):</strong> The most common method, where individuals are directly asked about their attitudes using surveys and questionnaires. It is direct and cost-effective but prone to social desirability bias.</li>
            <li><strong>Observation:</strong> Observing a person's behavior (e.g., purchasing patterns, website clicks) to infer their attitude. It measures actual behavior but doesn't explain the underlying motivation.</li>
            <li><strong>Physiological Measures (or Indirect Methods):</strong> Using biological responses (e.g., Galvanic Skin Response, pupil dilation) to gauge an emotional reaction. It provides objective data but can be expensive and ambiguous.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>2. SPECIFIC METHODS OF COLLECTING ATTITUDINAL DATA</h2>
        <p>These refer to the structured tools, primarily scaling techniques, used to quantify attitudes. Scales convert subjective attitudes into measurable numerical scores for statistical analysis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>3. COMPARATIVE SCALES</h2>
        <p>Comparative scales require respondents to directly compare one stimulus object (e.g., a brand) against another. The resulting data is typically ordinal (ranks/order).</p>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>3.1 Paired Comparison</h3>
            <p>The respondent is presented with two objects at a time and asked to select one based on a criterion (e.g., "Which brand do you prefer?"). Best for a small number of brands.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>3.2 Rank Order</h3>
            <p>The respondent is presented with several objects simultaneously and asked to rank them according to a specific criterion (e.g., 1st, 2nd, 3rd).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>3.3 Constant Sum</h3>
            <p>Respondents allocate a fixed number of points (e.g., 100 points) among several characteristics based on importance. This forces trade-offs and provides ratio-level data.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>3.4 Q-Sort</h3>
            <p>A scaling technique that uses a sophisticated rank order procedure to sort a large number of statements or objects into groups based on specified criteria, often forming a quasi-normal distribution.</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>4. NON-COMPARATIVE SCALES</h2>
        <p>Non-comparative scales (also called monadic scales) evaluate a single object independently. The resulting data is typically interval or ratio.</p>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4.1 Likert Scale</h3>
            <p>Respondents indicate their degree of agreement or disagreement with a series of statements. The standard format is a 5-point scale (e.g., 1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4.2 Semantic Differential</h3>
            <p>Respondents rate an object on a series of bipolar (opposite) adjectives or phrases, typically on a 7-point scale. Ideal for creating a "profile" of a brand.</p>
            <div class="example">
                <p>Powerful --- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 --- Weak</p>
                <p>Modern --- 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 --- Old-fashioned</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4.3 Stapel Scale</h3>
            <p>A unipolar (one-adjective) rating scale that measures both the direction and intensity of an attitude. It's typically a 10-point scale from +5 to -5, without a neutral zero.</p>
             <div class="example">
                <p>+5 +4 +3 +2 +1 --- <strong>Excellent Customer Service</strong> --- -1 -2 -3 -4 -5</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>5. WHICH SCALE TO USE?</h2>
        <p>The choice of scale depends on the research objective, the level of detail required, and the planned statistical analysis.</p>

        <h2>6. MEASURING EMOTIONS</h2>
        <p>Measuring emotions goes beyond measuring beliefs and actions to focus on the affective (feeling) component of attitude. Key techniques include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Self-Report:</strong> Using scales to describe feelings, such as the PAD (Pleasure-Arousal-Dominance) scale.</li>
            <li><strong>Physiological Measures (Neuromarketing):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Facial Coding:</strong> Analyzing micro-expressions to detect underlying emotions.</li>
                    <li><strong>EEG/fMRI:</strong> Measuring brain activity to map emotional responses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Eye Tracking:</strong> Measuring gaze duration and pupil dilation, which correlates with interest and arousal.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>7. PERCEPTUAL MAPPING</h2>
        <p><strong>Perceptual mapping</strong> is a visual technique used to display the perceptions of respondents about various brands on two or more dimensions. It's like a geographical map for brands: close brands are seen as similar, and distant brands as different. The axes are typically key attributes (e.g., Price vs. Quality).</p>
        <p>Uses of perceptual mapping include identifying competition, detecting market gaps, and monitoring brand positioning.</p>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Perceptual Map Analysis: Key Indian Automobile Brands</h3>
            <p>For the Indian automobile industry, the two most critical dimensions are typically <strong>Affordability vs. Premium</strong> (X-Axis) and <strong>Reliability/Value vs. Safety/Innovation</strong> (Y-Axis).</p>
             <div class="format-example">
                            </div>
            <h4>Strategic Implications</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Tata Motors' Strategy:</strong> Occupies a highly desirable space offering high safety and innovation at a mass-market price, positioning them as disruptors.</li>
                <li><strong>Maruti Suzuki's Strategy:</strong> Their challenge is to improve the perception of safety and technology without sacrificing their core positioning on affordability.</li>
                <li><strong>Mahindra's Strategy:</strong> They own the 'rugged, capable SUV' segment and aim to push further into the premium space.</li>
