        <h2>1. RESEARCH DESIGN CLASSIFICATION</h2>
        <p>A research design is a framework or blueprint for conducting a marketing research project. It specifies the details of the procedures necessary for obtaining the information needed to structure and solve marketing research problems. Research designs can be broadly classified as exploratory or conclusive.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Exploratory Research</h3>
            <p>Exploratory research has the primary objective of providing insights into and understanding the problem confronting the researcher. It is used when you must define the problem more precisely, identify relevant courses of action, or gain additional insights. The information needed is only loosely defined, and the research process is flexible and unstructured. The findings should be regarded as tentative.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Conclusive Research</h3>
            <p>Conclusive research is designed to assist the decision-maker in determining, evaluating, and selecting the best course of action. It is typically more formal and structured than exploratory research, based on large, representative samples, with data subjected to quantitative analysis. The findings are considered conclusive and are used as input for managerial decision-making.</p>
        </div>
        
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th></th>
                    <th>Exploratory</th>
                    <th>Conclusive</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Objective</strong></td>
                    <td>To provide insights and understanding</td>
                    <td>To test specific hypotheses and examine relationships</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td><strong>Characteristics</strong></td>
                    <td>Information needed is loosely defined. Research process is flexible and unstructured. Sample is small and non-representative.</td>
                    <td>Information needed is clearly defined. Research process is formal and structured. Sample is large and representative.</td>
                </tr>

                    <td><strong>Findings/Results</strong></td>
                    <td>Tentative</td>
                    <td>Conclusive</td>
                </tr>
                 <tr>
                    <td><strong>Outcome</strong></td>
                    <td>Generally followed by further research</td>
                    <td>Findings used as input into decision making</td>

        <h2>2. DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>Descriptive research is a type of conclusive research that has its major objective as the description of market characteristics or functions. It is conducted to:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Describe the characteristics of relevant groups (e.g., develop a profile of heavy users of Reliance Smart Bazaar).</li>
            <li>Estimate the percentage of a population exhibiting a certain behavior.</li>
            <li>Determine the perceptions of product characteristics.</li>
            <li>Determine the degree to which marketing variables are associated.</li>
            <li>Make specific predictions (e.g., forecast retail sales).</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Cross-Sectional Research</h3>
            <p>This is a type of observational study that analyzes data from a population, or a representative subset, at a specific point in time. Think of it as taking a "snapshot."</p>
            
            <h4>Single Cross-Sectional Research</h4>
            <p>This design examines a population at a single, specific point in time. It's like taking a single photograph of a large crowd to see who is there and what they are doing at that exact moment. It is ideal for understanding the prevalence of a condition.</p>

            <h4>Multiple Cross-Sectional Research</h4>
            <p>Also known as a trend study, this involves a series of independent studies conducted over time with the same target population, but with a new, independent sample each time. It allows researchers to track population-level changes and trends over a period. Instead of following the same people, you are taking a new "snapshot" of the population at different intervals.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>Longitudinal Research</h3>
            <p>This research design involves repeated observations of the same variables and subjects over an extended period. Unlike a cross-sectional study, longitudinal studies track changes and developments within the same individuals or groups over time, which is powerful for exploring cause-and-effect relationships.</p>
            
            <h4>Types of Longitudinal Studies</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Panel Study:</strong> The most common type, involving data collection from the same individuals at multiple time points. It is excellent for understanding individual-level change.</li>
                <li><strong>Cohort Study:</strong> Follows a group of people who share a common characteristic (e.g., birth year) over time to see how that characteristic relates to outcomes.</li>
                <li><strong>Retrospective Study:</strong> This design looks backward in time using existing data (e.g., medical records) to analyze past events and their relation to a current outcome.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>3. CAUSAL RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>Causal research aims to establish a cause-and-effect relationship between two or more variables. The goal is to determine if a change in one variable (the independent variable) directly causes a change in another variable (the dependent variable).</p>
        
        <div class="highlight-box">
            <p>It is a common error to confuse <strong>causation</strong> with <strong>correlation</strong>. Correlation simply means two variables are related (e.g., ice cream sales and sunburns are correlated). Causation means one variable directly causes the other (a third variable, hot weather, causes both ice cream sales and sunburns).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Independent Variable</h4>
            <p>The independent variable is the one that is controlled or manipulated by the researcher. It's the "cause" or the "input" in a study. For example, in a study on the effect of caffeine on alertness, the amount of caffeine given is the independent variable.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h4>Dependent Variable</h4>
            <p>The dependent variable is the one that is measured or observed. It is the "effect" or the "output" that is thought to be influenced by the independent variable. In the caffeine study, the participants' level of alertness is the dependent variable.</p>
