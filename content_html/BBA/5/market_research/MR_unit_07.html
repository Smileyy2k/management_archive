    <h1>UNIT 7: DATA COLLECTION ERRORS</h1>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>1. NATURE OF FIELDWORK</h2>
        <p>Fieldwork encompasses all activities related to gathering data from respondents. It involves the selection, training, supervision, and evaluation of fieldworkers (interviewers, observers, or technicians) who execute the data collection in the field.</p>
        <p>Fieldwork is the execution phase. It's when researchers leave the office and start talking to people. Since human interaction is involved, this stage is where most errors (like misinterpretation, bias, or outright cheating) can creep into the data, making strong management essential.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>2. THE FIELD/DATA COLLECTION PROCESS</h2>
        <p>This is a systematic, five-step process designed to ensure that data is collected accurately and uniformly across all respondents.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2.1 Selection of Fieldworkers</h3>
            <p>The goal is to hire reliable and skilled individuals who can adhere to the research protocol.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Develop Job Specification for Project:</strong> Determine the specific requirements (e.g., travel required, CAPI proficiency, language fluency).</li>
                <li><strong>Decide What Characteristics Fieldworkers Should Have:</strong> Match personal traits to the job demands.</li>
                <li><strong>Recruit Appropriate Individuals:</strong> Hire based on qualifications.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2.2 Training of Fieldworkers</h3>

            <h3>2.3 Supervision of Fieldworkers</h3>
            <p>Supervision ensures that the fieldworkers are following the procedures and prevents interviewer fraud.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Quality Control and Editing:</strong> The supervisor checks completed questionnaires for completeness, legibility, and internal consistency (e.g., an answer in question 5 contradicts question 1). This is done during the fieldwork phase.</li>
                <li><strong>Sampling Control:</strong> Ensuring interviewers strictly follow the predetermined sampling plan (e.g., only interviewing females aged 18-24 in a specified block). This prevents interviewers from taking shortcuts.</li>
                <li><strong>Central Office Control:</strong> Monitoring the overall data collection progress, schedule, and cost metrics from a central location.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2.4 Validation of Fieldwork</h3>
            <p>Validation is a quality control procedure involving independent verification that the fieldworker actually conducted the interviews. This is specifically designed to combat falsification (interviewer fabricating entire interviews or parts of them).</p>
            <p>The manager calls or emails a small percentage (typically to 25%) of the people supposedly interviewed to ask verification questions: "Did someone from our company call you last Tuesday? What was your age group? How long did the interview take?" If the answers don't match, the entire interview might be suspect.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2.5 Evaluation of Fieldworkers</h3>
            <p>Evaluation is the final review of fieldworker performance, used for compensation, retention, and feedback.</p>
