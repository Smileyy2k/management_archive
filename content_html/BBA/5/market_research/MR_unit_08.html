    <h1>UNIT 8: MEASUREMENT IN MARKET RESEARCH</h1>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>1. MEASUREMENT AND SCALING</h2>
        <p><strong>Measurement:</strong> The process of assigning numbers or symbols to characteristics of objects (e.g., consumers, brands, advertisements) according to a set of pre-specified rules. Measurement is the decision to use a number (like 1 out of 5) to represent an abstract idea (like "Satisfaction").</p>
        <p><strong>Scaling:</strong> The actual creation of a continuum upon which measured objects are located. Scaling is the tool you use—the actual 5-point scale itself.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>2. SCALE CHARACTERISTICS AND LEVELS OF MEASUREMENT</h2>
        <p>Scales differ based on the properties their numbers possess. There are four basic characteristics, and the highest characteristic a scale possesses determines its level of measurement.</p>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2.1 Description</h3>
            <p>The scale uses unique labels or descriptors to differentiate between objects (e.g., names, numbers, letters). Every object has a unique identifier. (This is the only characteristic of a Nominal Scale).</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2.2 Order</h3>
            <p>The relative size or magnitude of the scale values can be determined; one value is greater than another. We can rank items. We know A is better than B, but not by how much.</p>
        </div>
        
        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2.3 Distance</h3>
            <p>The differences between any two scale points are equal and meaningful. The difference between 1 and 2 is the same as the difference between 4 and 5.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>2.4 Origin</h3>
            <p>The scale has a unique, fixed starting point or a true zero point (meaning the complete absence of the characteristic being measured). Zero actually means "nothing" (e.g., 0 units sold, 0 income).</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    
    <div class="topic">
        <h2>3. PRIMARY SCALES OF MEASUREMENT</h2>
        <p>These are the four fundamental types of scales, arranged from weakest (least information) to strongest (most information).</p>
        
        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>3.1 Nominal Scale</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Characteristic:</strong> Description only.</li>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> Numbers serve only as labels or tags for identifying and classifying objects.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Gender (1=Male, 2=Female), Brand Choice (1=Coke, 2=Pepsi).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>3.2 Ordinal Scale</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Description and Order.</li>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> Numbers indicate the relative ranking of objects, but the distance between the ranks is unknown.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Market ranking (1st, 2nd, 3rd), Social Class (High, Medium, Low).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        
        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>3.3 Interval Scale</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Description, Order, and Distance.</li>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> The distances between adjacent scale points are equal, but the zero point is arbitrary (not a true zero).</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Temperature in Celsius/Fahrenheit, Attitude Scales (e.g., Likert). A score of 40 isn't twice as hot as 20°.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="guideline">
            <h3>3.4 Ratio Scale</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Characteristics:</strong> Description, Order, Distance, and Origin (True Zero).</li>
                <li><strong>Function:</strong> Possesses all four properties, allowing for meaningful ratios to be calculated. Zero indicates the total absence of the property.</li>
                <li><strong>Example:</strong> Income, Age, Weight, Market Share. (A market share of 10% is twice as large as 5%).</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="topic">
        <h2>4. SCALE EVALUATION</h2>
        <p>Once a scale is created, researchers must evaluate its quality based on its accuracy and consistency.</p>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4.1 Measurement Accuracy</h3>
            <p>The goal of measurement is to achieve a true score, free of error. The True Score Model is represented as: <strong>XO = XT + XS + XR</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>XO:</strong> Observed Score (The answer recorded)</li>
                <li><strong>XT:</strong> True Score (The actual level of the characteristic)</li>
                <li><strong>XS:</strong> Systematic Error (Constant bias, affects the mean)</li>
                <li><strong>XR:</strong> Random Error (Fluctuating bias, affects consistency)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Systematic Error:</strong> An error that consistently affects the measurement in the same way (e.g., a poorly phrased question). It is a predictable bias.</p>
            <p><strong>Random Error:</strong> Error that varies randomly from one respondent to the next (e.g., a respondent being momentarily distracted). It affects the precision of the measurement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4.2 Reliability (Consistency)</h3>
            <p>Reliability is the extent to which a measurement scale is free from random error and yields consistent results if repeated.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Test-Retest Reliability:</strong> Administering the same scale to the same respondents at two different points in time.</li>
                <li><strong>Alternative Forms Reliability:</strong> Constructing two equivalent versions of a scale and administering both to the same respondents.</li>
                <li><strong>Internal Consistency Reliability:</strong> Assessing whether the different items that make up a multi-item scale are measuring the same characteristic, typically measured using Cronbach's alpha.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="subsection">
            <h3>4.3 Validity (Accuracy)</h3>
            <p>Validity is the extent to which a scale measures what it is supposed to measure. A valid scale must first be reliable.</p>

                        <td><strong>Does it cover everything?</strong> A subjective evaluation of how well the scale's content represents the entire domain of the construct. (e.g., A test on "Math Skills" should include Algebra and Geometry, not just addition).</td>

                        <td><strong>Does it correlate with other outcomes?</strong> Measures whether the scale performs as expected in relation to a relevant outcome. (e.g., Does a "Product Attitude" score predict the actual purchase?).</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Construct Validity</strong></td>
                        <td><strong>Does it measure the theory?</strong> Measures how well the scale taps into the abstract theoretical concept it was designed to measure.</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td><strong>Construct Sub-types</strong></td>
                        <td><strong>Convergent Validity:</strong> The scale correlates highly with other known measures of the same construct. <strong>Discriminant Validity:</strong> The scale does not correlate with measures of different constructs.</td>

            <h3>4.4 Generalizability</h3>
            <p>Generalizability is the degree to which a measurement can be applied across different populations, settings, and methods of measurement. Can this scale be used effectively on people of different ages, in different countries, or collected through different methods (online vs. phone)? If a scale works well only in one specific context, its generalizability is low.</p>
