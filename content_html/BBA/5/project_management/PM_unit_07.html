    <h1>UNIT 7: Risk Analysis in Capital Investment Decisions</h1>

    <h2>1. DEFINITION OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY</h2>
    <p>**Risk** is the **quantifiable variability** or dispersion of the actual returns (cash flows) a project generates compared to the expected returns. Probabilities can be assigned to the possible outcomes.</p>
    <p>**Uncertainty** relates to situations where the potential outcomes are so ill-defined or the historical data is so limited that it is impossible or extremely difficult to assign probabilities to the outcomes.</p>

    <h2>2. PROJECT RISK MANAGEMENT (PRM)</h2>
    <p>PRM is the systematic process of identifying, analyzing, planning, and controlling risks throughout the life cycle of a project.</p>

    <h3>The Four-Step PRM Process</h3>
    <table class="data-table">
        <tr><th>Phase</th><th>Action</th><th>Goal</th></tr>
        <tr><td>**Risk Identification**</td><td>Determine which risks might affect the project and document their characteristics (e.g., source, cause).</td><td>Create a comprehensive **Risk Register**.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Risk Analysis**</td><td>Quantify the risk (Probability Ã— Impact). Assess the likelihood of occurrence and the potential severity of impact.</td><td>**Prioritize risks** (e.g., using a High/Medium/Low matrix).</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Risk Response Planning**</td><td>Develop options and actions to enhance opportunities (positive risks) and reduce threats (negative risks) to project objectives.</td><td>Create detailed strategies for each major risk.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Risk Monitoring & Control**</td><td>Track identified risks, monitor residual risks, identify new risks, and execute the planned risk responses.</td><td>Ensure the project stays on track and within the risk appetite.</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h2>3. RISK RESPONSE STRATEGIES (FOR THREATS)</h2>
    <p>Strategies for handling risks that could negatively affect the project.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>**Avoid:** Eliminating the threat by removing its cause (e.g., changing the scope, using a different technology).</li>
        <li>**Transfer:** Shifting the impact (and financial responsibility) of a threat to a third party (e.g., purchasing insurance, using fixed-price contracts).</li>
        <li>**Mitigate:** Taking action to reduce the probability or impact of a risk event to an acceptable threshold (e.g., conducting extra testing, using a simpler design).</li>
        <li>**Accept:** Deciding not to take any action to address the risk, either passively (doing nothing) or actively (setting aside a contingency reserve/budget).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. TECHNIQUES FOR RISK ANALYSIS IN CAPITAL BUDGETING</h2>
    <p>These techniques adjust the appraisal criteria (like NPV or IRR) to account for risk.</p>

    <h3>i. Sensitivity Analysis</h3>
    <p>A technique that tests how the NPV (or IRR) changes when **one critical variable** (e.g., sales volume, cost of materials, discount rate) is changed, while others are held constant.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Goal:** To identify the variables that are most crucial to the project's success (i.e., the ones where a small change causes a large change in NPV).</li>
        <li>**Limitation:** It only changes one variable at a time, ignoring the correlation between variables (e.g., material cost and selling price might move together).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ii. Scenario Analysis</h3>
    <p>This technique analyzes the project's outcome (NPV) under a limited number of predefined, internally consistent scenarios (e.g., 'Worst Case,' 'Most Likely Case,' 'Best Case').</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Goal:** To account for the simultaneous change in multiple variables under different economic environments (e.g., a recession scenario changes both sales volume and material costs).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>iii. Risk-Adjusted Discount Rate (RADR)</h3>
    <p>The RADR approach adjusts the standard Cost of Capital ($k$) by adding a **risk premium ($\Delta k$)** that reflects the perceived risk of the project.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Formula:** $\text{Discount Rate} = \text{Risk-Free Rate} + \text{Risk Premium}$</li>
        <li>**Logic:** A higher discount rate (RADR) penalizes riskier projects by reducing the Present Value (PV) of their distant future cash flows more heavily, thus lowering their NPV.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>iv. Certainty Equivalent (CE) Approach</h3>
    <p>This method adjusts the cash flows themselves, rather than the discount rate, to account for risk. Uncertain future cash flows are converted to "certainty equivalent" cash flows by multiplying them by a **certainty equivalent coefficient ($\alpha$)** (a value between 0 and 1).</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Formula:** $\text{NPV} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_t \times \alpha_t}{(1+\text{Risk-Free Rate})^t} - \text{Initial Investment}$</li>
        <li>**Logic:** The adjusted (lower) cash flow is then discounted using the **risk-free rate ($R_f$)**, as the risk has already been removed from the cash flow.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. DECISION TREE ANALYSIS (DTA)</h2>
    <p>A decision tree is a diagram that maps out a sequence of **decisions** and **probabilistic outcomes** (chance events) that follow each decision, especially in multi-stage projects.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Decision Node (Square):** Represents a point where a choice must be made (e.g., launch project, abandon project).</li>
        <li>**Chance Node (Circle):** Represents a point where an uncertain event will occur (e.g., market success or failure), with probabilities assigned to each outcome.</li>
        <li>**Application:** Useful for projects involving **staged investments** (Go/No-Go decisions) and calculating the **Expected Monetary Value (EMV)** for each path to find the optimal decision sequence.</li>
    </ul>
