    <h1>UNIT 4: Technical Analysis</h1>

    <h2>1. PROJECT PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT</h2>
    <p>Project procurement management includes the processes necessary to <strong>purchase or acquire products, services, or results</strong> needed from outside the project team to perform the work.</p>

    <h3>Make-or-Buy Analysis</h3>
    <p>This is a fundamental decision-making process where the project team determines whether specific work or deliverables should be <strong>produced internally (Make)</strong> or </strong>purchased from external vendors (Buy)</strong>.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h4>Make (Internal Production) Factors:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost Considerations:</strong> Compare internal production costs vs. external purchase costs.</li>
            <li><strong>Quality Control:</strong> Desire for better control over quality standards.</li>
            <li><strong>Intellectual Property:</strong> Need to protect proprietary knowledge and processes.</li>
            <li><strong>Strategic Capability:</strong> Develop or maintain internal capabilities that are strategic.</li>
            <li><strong>Capacity Utilization:</strong> Use available internal capacity effectively.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Buy (External Procurement) Factors:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Cost Efficiency:</strong> Suppliers may have cost advantages through specialization and economies of scale.</li>
            <li><strong>Expertise Access:</strong> Access to specialized skills and technologies not available internally.</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on Core Business:</strong> Concentrate internal resources on core competencies.</li>
            <li><strong>Risk Transfer:</strong> Transfer certain risks (e.g., performance, schedule) to suppliers.</li>
            <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> Easier to scale up or down based on demand.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2>2. TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: PLANT CAPACITY AND LOCATION</h2>

    <h3>Plant Capacity</h3>
    <p>Plant capacity is the <strong>maximum sustainable output rate</strong> a production facility can achieve. It's crucial because it affects operating efficiency, cost structure, and the project's ability to meet projected demand.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h4>Types of Capacity:</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Installed/Rated Capacity:</strong> The maximum output rate a plant is designed to achieve under ideal conditions. (Theoretical maximum).</li>
            <li><strong>Normal/Practical Capacity:</strong> The realistic maximum output rate achievable, considering planned maintenance, normal delays, and expected inefficiencies. (Practical limit).</li>
            <li><strong>Achieved Capacity:</strong> The actual output rate obtained over a specific period. (Actual output).</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The technical analysis must ensure the <strong>Normal/Practical Capacity</strong> is sufficient to meet the </strong>Projected Demand</strong> identified in the market analysis.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Factors Influencing Plant Location</h3>
    <p>Selecting the optimal plant location involves balancing various cost, market, and environmental factors.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Proximity to Raw Materials:</strong> Minimizes transport costs for bulky or perishable materials.</li>
        <li><strong>Proximity to Market:</strong> Reduces costs and time for delivering finished goods to customers (crucial for fragile or high-volume products).</li>
        <li><strong>Availability of Infrastructure:</strong> Access to reliable power, water supply, communication links, and transport networks (roads, rail, ports).</li>
        <li><strong>Availability of Labour:</strong> Presence of skilled/unskilled labor pool at reasonable wage rates.</li>
        <li><strong>Government Policies and Incentives:</strong> Tax breaks, subsidies, or relaxed regulations in specific zones (e.g., SEZs, backward areas).</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental and Regulatory Factors:</strong> Compliance with local pollution control laws and ease of getting environmental clearance.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. TECHNOLOGY AND EQUIPMENT SELECTION</h2>

    <h3>Technology Selection Criteria</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Appropriateness:</strong> Is the technology the most suitable for the scale and quality requirements of the project?</li>
        <li><strong>Cost-Effectiveness:</strong> Comparing the total cost of ownership (purchase, installation, maintenance, and operating costs) of different technologies.</li>
        <li><strong>Scalability and Flexibility:</strong> Can the technology be easily scaled up/down? Can it handle variations in product mix?</li>
        <li><strong>Environmental Impact:</strong> Does the technology minimize waste and pollution?</li>
        <li><strong>Local Availability:</strong> Is the technology and its spare parts readily available and maintainable by local technicians?</li>
        <li><strong>Track Record:</strong> Has the technology been proven successful in similar operating environments?</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Equipment Selection</h3>
    <p>Equipment selection focuses on specific machinery required for the chosen technology.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Technical Specifications:</strong> Matching capacity, precision, and speed requirements.</li>
        <li><strong>Supplier Reliability:</strong> Assessing the vendor's reputation, warranty, and after-sales service.</li>
        <li><strong>Operating Efficiency:</strong> Energy consumption and maintenance costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Residual Value:</strong> Estimating the resale value of the equipment at the end of its useful life.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. PROJECT SCHEDULING AND PRECEDENCE DIAGRAMMING</h2>

    <h3>Project Scheduling</h3>
    <p>Project scheduling is the process of creating a timeline for the project by identifying activities, estimating their duration, and sequencing them to determine the total time required for completion.</p>

    <h3>Activity Dependency Types (Precedence Relationships)</h3>
    <p>These relationships define the logical order in which activities must be performed. The two primary types are:</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Finish-to-Start (FS):</strong> Activity B </strong>cannot start</strong> until Activity A <strong>finishes</strong>. (Most common).
            <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> Painting (B) cannot start until wall construction (A) finishes.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Start-to-Start (SS):</strong> Activity B </strong>can only start</strong> once Activity A <strong>has started</strong>.
            <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> Drafting the final report (B) can start as soon as data analysis (A) starts.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Finish-to-Finish (FF):</strong> Activity B </strong>cannot finish</strong> until Activity A <strong>finishes</strong>.
            <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> System testing (B) cannot finish until all coding modules (A) are finished.</li></ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Start-to-Finish (SF):</strong> Activity B </strong>finishes</strong> when Activity A <strong>starts</strong>. (Very rare).
            <ul><li><strong>Example:</strong> Training the replacement team (B) must finish the day the old team hands over (A).</li></ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Precedence Diagramming Method (PDM) / Activity-on-Node (AON)</h3>
    <p>Activities are represented as <strong>nodes</strong> (boxes), and the relationships (dependencies) between them are shown as </strong>arrows</strong>. This is the most widely used method for project network diagrams.</p>
