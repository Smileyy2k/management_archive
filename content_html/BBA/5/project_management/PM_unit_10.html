    <h1>UNIT 10: Project Management Processes</h1>

    <h2>1. PROJECT PLANNING</h2>

    <h3>1.1 Meaning and Objectives</h3>
    <p>**Meaning of Planning:** The process of establishing project objectives, identifying the activities required to achieve them, determining the resources needed, and defining the sequence and schedule of these activities.</p>
    <p>**Objectives:** To provide a roadmap for execution, ensure the optimal allocation of resources, identify potential risks, establish a baseline for performance measurement, and align all stakeholders.</p>

    <h3>1.2 Process of Planning (The Project Management Plan)</h3>
    <p>The planning process is iterative and includes defining the scope, schedule, and cost baselines.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>**Defining Scope:** Determining the project boundaries and deliverables.</li>
        <li>**Creating the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS):** Decomposing the major deliverables into smaller, manageable tasks.</li>
        <li>**Activity Definition:** Identifying the specific tasks needed to produce the deliverables.</li>
        <li>**Sequence and Dependency Determination:** Establishing the order in which tasks must be performed.</li>
        <li>**Resource Estimation:** Determining the types and quantities of resources (people, equipment, materials) needed.</li>
        <li>**Time Estimation:** Forecasting the duration of each activity.</li>
        <li>**Schedule Development:** Creating the project timetable (e.g., using Gantt Charts, Critical Path Method).</li>
        <li>**Cost Estimation and Budgeting:** Determining the total budget and allocating funds to tasks.</li>
        <li>**Risk Planning:** Developing strategies to handle identified risks (Mitigate, Avoid, Transfer, Accept).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. PROJECT EXECUTION</h2>
    <p>The process of performing the work defined in the Project Management Plan to achieve the project objectives. This phase consumes most of the project budget and resources.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Direct and Manage Project Work:** Carrying out the planned activities (e.g., construction, coding, testing).</li>
        <li>**Managing Project Team:** Acquiring, developing, and managing the team members.</li>
        <li>**Managing Communications and Stakeholders:** Ensuring timely collection, creation, distribution, storage, and ultimate disposition of project information.</li>
        <li>**Quality Assurance:** Auditing the quality requirements and results from quality control measurements to ensure appropriate quality standards are used.</li>
        <li>**Procurement Management:** Managing the contracts and relationships with external vendors/suppliers.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. PROJECT MONITORING AND CONTROL</h2>
    <p>The process of tracking, reviewing, and regulating the progress and performance of the project; identifying any areas in which the plan requires changes; and initiating the corresponding changes.</p>

    <h3>Key Monitoring and Control Activities</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>**Performance Measurement:** Comparing actual performance against the baselines (Scope, Schedule, Cost).</li>
        <li>**Earned Value Management (EVM):** A method that integrates scope, schedule, and cost to assess project performance.
            <ul>
                <li>**PV (Planned Value):** Budgeted cost of work scheduled.</li>
                <li>**EV (Earned Value):** Budgeted cost of work performed.</li>
                <li>**AC (Actual Cost):** Actual cost of work performed.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**Variance Analysis:** Calculating schedule variance (SV = EV - PV) and cost variance (CV = EV - AC).</li>
        <li>**Change Control:** Managing and approving/rejecting all change requests (scope, schedule, budget) through a formal Integrated Change Control process.</li>
        <li>**Risk Monitoring:** Tracking residual and secondary risks and executing planned response strategies.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. PROJECT CLOSURE</h2>
    <p>The process of finalizing all activities across all process groups to formally complete the project, phase, or contract and formally transfer the project's output.</p>

    <h3>7.2 Methods of Project Termination</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>**Termination by Extinction:** The project is **completed** (successfully or unsuccessfully) or suddenly stopped. The work is done, or the project is deemed a failure/no longer necessary.</li>
        <li>**Termination by Addition:** The project is successfully completed, and its output (e.g., a new product division or system) is **absorbed into the parent organization** as a permanent functional unit.</li>
        <li>**Termination by Integration:** The project's resources (people, systems) are simply **distributed back into the existing functional units** of the parent organization.</li>
        <li>**Termination by Starvation:** Slowly cutting off the project's budget or resources until it quietly diesâ€”a poor method, often used to avoid announcing failure.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>7.3 Process of Project Termination</h3>
    <p>The formal closure process ensures a clean and well-documented close:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Completion of Deliverables:** Ensuring all scope elements are finalized and formally accepted by the customer.</li>
        <li>**Contract Closure:** Finalizing all administrative and contractual agreements with vendors and suppliers.</li>
        <li>**Final Report:** Documenting performance against baselines, analyzing variances, and confirming customer sign-off.</li>
        <li>**Lessons Learned:** Conducting a post-mortem review to document what worked well and what could be improved for future projects.</li>
        <li>**Releasing Resources:** Disbanding the project team and reassigning resources to other functional areas or projects.</li>
    </ul>
