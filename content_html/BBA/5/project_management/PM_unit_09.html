    <h1>UNIT 9: Social Cost Benefit Analysis (SCBA)</h1>

    <h2>1. SOCIAL COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS (SCBA)</h2>
    <p>SCBA is an economic evaluation technique used to appraise projects from the viewpoint of the **entire society or economy**, rather than solely from the perspective of the investing organization.</p>
    <p>It involves systematically identifying, measuring, and valuing all costs and benefits—including those **external effects (externalities)** that do not appear in conventional financial accounts—to determine the **net contribution of the project to national welfare**.</p>

    <h2>2. RATIONALE FOR SCBA</h2>
    <p>SCBA is necessary because the **market prices** used in financial analysis are often **distorted** and do not reflect the true scarcity value or opportunity cost to society.</p>

    <h3>Reasons for Market Price Distortion:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>**Taxes and Subsidies:** Taxes (like GST) inflate prices, while subsidies deflate them, meaning neither reflects the actual economic cost of production.</li>
        <li>**Externalities:** Projects create costs (like pollution, noise) or benefits (like improved infrastructure, reduced traffic congestion) for third parties that are not compensated or paid for.</li>
        <li>**Market Imperfections:** Monopoly power, price controls, and unemployment (especially of unskilled labor) prevent market prices from reflecting true social opportunity costs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. SHADOW PRICING (ACCOUNTING PRICES)</h2>
    <p>**Shadow Prices** (or Accounting Prices) are the true economic value of a good, service, or resource, adjusted to reflect its actual scarcity value or opportunity cost to the society, net of all market distortions.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Objective:** To replace distorted market prices with prices that truly reflect the social value and cost of resources.</li>
        <li>**Application:** In SCBA, a shadow price is used for calculating the cost/benefit instead of the observed market price.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Shadow Pricing for Key Factors:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>**Foreign Exchange:** The market exchange rate is often controlled or distorted. The shadow price of foreign exchange is its **true social cost**, reflecting the value of imports saved or exports generated.</li>
        <li>**Labour:** Due to high unemployment, the **social opportunity cost** of unskilled labour (the lost output from alternative employment) is often **lower** than the market wage rate. Using a lower shadow price encourages employment-generating projects.</li>
        <li>**Capital:** The social cost of capital (Social Discount Rate, SDR) is used instead of the market interest rate (which is distorted by taxes and risk), reflecting society's time preference for consumption.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>4. UNIDO APPROACH TO SCBA (United Nations Industrial Development Organization)</h2>
    <p>The UNIDO approach provides a five-step framework for project evaluation by systematically adjusting financial values to arrive at social values.</p>

    <table class="data-table">
        <tr><th>Stage</th><th>Focus of Analysis</th><th>Key Concept</th></tr>
        <tr><td>**Stage 1: Financial Profitability (Market Prices)**</td><td>Calculate profitability from the commercial (firm’s) viewpoint.</td><td>Uses unadjusted market prices.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Stage 2: Economic/SCBA Profitability (Shadow Prices)**</td><td>Recalculate profitability from the national (society's) viewpoint.</td><td>Replace all market prices with **Shadow Prices**.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Stage 3: Adjustments for Externalities**</td><td>Identify and value all social costs (e.g., pollution, displacement) and social benefits (e.g., training, infrastructure) not included in financial accounts.</td><td>Quantify and value **Externalities**.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Stage 4: Adjustments for Savings and Investment**</td><td>Account for the social value of funds, as society values a rupee invested more than a rupee consumed.</td><td>Determine the **Consumption vs. Investment** social weights.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Stage 5: Adjustments for Income Distribution**</td><td>Examine how the project's benefits and costs are distributed across different income groups (e.g., rich vs. poor).</td><td>Apply **Distributional Weights** to favor benefits accruing to the poor.</td></tr>
    </table>
    <p>The final result is the **Net Social Benefit (NSB)**, which determines the project's worth to the nation.</p>

    <h2>5. PUBLIC SECTOR INVESTMENT IN INDIA</h2>
    <p>SCBA is most directly and crucially applied to **Public Sector Investment** in India. Public sector projects (like metro rail, dams, or public health initiatives) are typically undertaken not for profit maximization, but for the maximization of **social welfare**.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Justification of Public Projects:** Projects are justified based on their Net Social Benefit (NSB).</li>
        <li>**Shadow Pricing for Labour:** The social cost of using unskilled labour is often valued lower than its market wage to incentivize projects that generate significant **employment**, making job creation a social benefit.</li>
        <li>**Distributional Weights:** SCBA helps ensure that large infrastructure projects do not disproportionately burden the poor while benefiting the wealthy, thereby addressing social equity goals.</li>
    </ul>
