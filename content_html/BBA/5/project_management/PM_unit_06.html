    <h1>UNIT 6: Appraisal Criteria</h1>

    <h2>1. WHAT IS PROJECT APPRAISAL?</h2>
    <p>Project Appraisal is the **systematic and comprehensive analysis** of an investment proposal (a project) to determine its **viability, sustainability**, and alignment with the organization's strategic objectives before resources are committed.</p>
    <p>It involves evaluating various facets of the project, including financial, economic, technical, managerial, and social aspects.</p>

    <h3>Objectives of Appraisal:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>To select the most **profitable or strategically important projects** from multiple alternatives.</li>
        <li>To allocate **scarce resources** (like capital and skilled labour) efficiently.</li>
        <li>To ensure the project aligns with the company's long-term goals.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. DEFINING CASH FLOW (CF)</h2>
    <p>Cash flow is the movement of money into (inflows) and out of (outflows) a business or project over a specific period. For project appraisal, it is crucial to define which cash flows are relevant based on the perspective.</p>

    <div class="highlight-box">
        <h4>A. Cash Flow from Long-Term Equity (Shareholders' Point of View)</h4>
        <p>This perspective focuses on the funds remaining for equity holders after all other obligations have been met.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevant Cash Flow:</strong> Profit After Tax (PAT) + Depreciation - Investment in Fixed Assets - Repayment of Debt + New Borrowings.</p>

        <h4>B. Cash Flow from Long-Term Lenders (Creditors' Point of View)</h4>
        <p>This perspective focuses on the return to the lending institutions.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevant Cash Flow:</strong> Interest Received + Principal Repayment Received.</p>

        <h4>C. Cash Flow for the Project as a Whole (Total Capital View)</h4>
        <p>This perspective ignores the source of funds (debt vs. equity) and is the most common for capital budgeting.</p>
        <p><strong>Relevant Cash Flow:</strong> Profit After Tax (PAT) + Depreciation + Interest (1-Tax Rate) - Investment in Fixed Assets.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>3. APPRAISAL CRITERIA: DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW (DCF) TECHNIQUES</h2>
    <p>DCF methods recognize the **Time Value of Money (TVM)**, meaning a rupee received today is worth more than a rupee received tomorrow. This is done by discounting future cash flows back to the present using a discount rate (usually the Cost of Capital, WACC).</p>

    <h3>i. Net Present Value (NPV)</h3>
    <p>NPV is the **sum of the present values (PV) of all project cash inflows minus the sum of the present values of all cash outflows**. The initial investment is a cash outflow at time zero.</p>
    <p class="formula-box">
        $$
        \text{NPV} = \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_t}{(1+k)^t} - \text{Initial Investment}
        $$
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Decision Rule:** Accept the project if **NPV > 0**. Reject if NPV < 0.</li>
        <li>**Selection Rule (Mutually Exclusive Projects):** Select the project with the **highest positive NPV**.</li>
        <li>**Merit:** Provides the theoretical change in wealth (in today's rupees) resulting from the project.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ii. Internal Rate of Return (IRR)</h3>
    <p>IRR is the **discount rate (r)** that makes the project's Net Present Value (NPV) equal to **zero**. It represents the expected rate of return the project will generate.</p>
    <p class="formula-box">
        $$
        \sum_{t=1}^{n} \frac{\text{Cash Flow}_t}{(1+\text{IRR})^t} - \text{Initial Investment} = 0
        $$
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Decision Rule:** Accept the project if **IRR > Cost of Capital ($k$)**. Reject if IRR < k.</li>
        <li>**Merit:** Easy to understand and communicate to non-financial managers (it's a rate of return).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>iii. Profitability Index (PI) / Benefit-Cost Ratio</h3>
    <p>PI is the ratio of the present value of future cash inflows to the present value of cash outflows (or Initial Investment). It measures the benefit per rupee of cost.</p>
    <p class="formula-box">
        $$
        \text{PI} = \frac{\text{Present Value of Cash Inflows}}{\text{Present Value of Cash Outflows}}
        $$
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Decision Rule:** Accept the project if **PI > 1**. Reject if PI < 1.</li>
        <li>**Merit:** Useful for ranking projects when there is a **capital rationing** constraint.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. APPRAISAL CRITERIA: NON-DCF TECHNIQUES</h2>
    <p>These methods do **not** consider the Time Value of Money (TVM), making them less accurate for long-term projects but simpler to calculate.</p>

    <h3>i. Payback Period (PBP)</h3>
    <p>The **time period** required for the cumulative cash inflows from the project to equal the initial investment.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Decision Rule:** Accept the project if its PBP is **less than** a pre-determined maximum payback period set by management.</li>
        <li>**Merit:** Simple to calculate; measures liquidity and risk exposure (shorter PBP means faster recovery of funds).</li>
        <li>**Demerit:** Ignores cash flows occurring after the payback period; ignores TVM.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ii. Accounting Rate of Return (ARR) / Average Rate of Return</h3>
    <p>ARR expresses the average annual accounting profit generated by a project as a percentage of the average or initial investment.</p>
    <p class="formula-box">
        $$
        \text{ARR} = \frac{\text{Average Annual Net Income}}{\text{Average Investment}} \times 100
        $$
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Decision Rule:** Accept the project if ARR is **greater than** a pre-determined target rate.</li>
        <li>**Demerit:** Uses accounting profit (not cash flow); ignores TVM.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. HANDLING COMPLEX APPRAISAL ISSUES</h2>

    <h3>i. Projects with Unequal Lives</h3>
    <p>When comparing mutually exclusive projects with different operational lives, simple NPV comparison is flawed. The standard solution is:</p>
    <p>Solution: Use the **Equivalent Annual Annuity (EAA)** method.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>EAA converts the NPV of a project into an equal annual cash flow equivalent over its life.</li>
        <li>**Decision Rule:** Select the project with the **higher EAA**.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>ii. Projects Subject to Capital Rationing</h3>
    <p>This occurs when a firm has profitable projects (NPV > 0) but lacks sufficient funds to invest in all of them.</p>
    <p>Solution: Use the **Profitability Index (PI)**.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Decision Rule:** Rank projects by their PI and choose the highest-ranking projects until the available capital is exhausted.</li>
    </ul>
