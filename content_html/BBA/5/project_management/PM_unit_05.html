    <h1>UNIT 5: Financial Projections</h1>

    <h2>1. COST OF THE PROJECT</h2>
    <p>Project cost is the total expenditure required to implement and operate the project until it reaches commercial production or operational status. It includes all capital and pre-operative expenses.</p>

    <h3>Project Cost Components</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):</strong> Investment in long-term assets.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Fixed Assets:</strong> Land, building, plant & machinery, equipment.</li>
                <li><strong>Intangible Assets:</strong> Software, patents, licenses, preliminary expenses.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Working Capital:</strong> Funds needed for day-to-day operations.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Net Working Capital</strong> = Current Assets (Raw materials, finished goods, debtors, cash) - Current Liabilities (Creditors, accrued expenses).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Pre-operative Expenses:</strong> Expenses incurred before commercial operations begin.
            <ul>
                <li>Feasibility studies, legal fees, trial runs, training costs, interest during construction period.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Contingency (5-10% of total cost):</strong> An allocation for unforeseen expenses, price escalations, or minor design changes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cost Estimation Methods</h3>
    <p>Techniques used to predict the cost of a project, varying in accuracy and detail.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Analogous Estimation (Top-Down):</strong> Uses data from similar, completed past projects to estimate the current project's cost.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Quick, used in early stages when information is limited.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Less accurate due to potential differences between projects.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Parametric Estimation:</strong> Uses a <strong>statistical relationship</strong> between historical data and other variables (e.g., cost per square foot, cost per line of code) to calculate an estimate.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Highly accurate if the relationship is reliable and scale is a key factor.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Requires good historical data and a quantifiable variable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Bottom-Up Estimation:</strong> The most detailed method, where the cost of individual work packages is estimated and then aggregated to get the total project cost.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Pros:</strong> Most accurate and detailed.</li>
                <li><strong>Cons:</strong> Time-consuming and requires a fully defined Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. SOURCES OF FINANCE</h2>
    <p>Financial sources are broadly categorized into internal and external, and equity and debt.</p>

    <h3>Internal Sources</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Retained Earnings:</strong> Profits kept in the business rather than paid out as dividends.</li>
        <li><strong>Sale of Assets:</strong> Disposal of non-core or surplus assets.</li>
        <li><strong>Depreciation Provision:</strong> Non-cash expense that generates internal funds for replacement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>External Sources</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Equity:</strong> Funds raised by issuing ownership shares.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Ordinary Shares/Common Stock:</strong> Permanent capital with voting rights.</li>
                <li><strong>Preference Shares:</strong> Fixed dividend, priority in repayment, no/limited voting rights.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Debt:</strong> Borrowed funds that must be repaid with interest.
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Term Loans:</strong> Long-term funding from commercial banks or financial institutions.</li>
                <li><strong>Debentures/Bonds:</strong> Secured or unsecured debt instruments issued to the public.</li>
                <li><strong>Working Capital Finance:</strong> Short-term loans like cash credit, overdraft, or trade credit.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Hybrid Finance:</strong> Instruments that combine features of both debt and equity (e.g., convertible debentures, venture capital).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. PROJECTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>

    <h3>1. Projected Income Statement (Profit & Loss)</h3>
    <p>This statement projects the project's profitability over a period by matching revenues and expenses.</p>
    <table class="data-table">
        <tr><th>Component</th><th>Description</th></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Sales Revenue</strong></td><td>Projected volume × Unit Price</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)</strong></td><td>Direct costs like raw materials, labor, and factory overhead.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Gross Profit</strong></td><td>Sales Revenue - COGS</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Operating Expenses</strong></td><td>Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) costs.</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>EBIT (Earnings Before Interest & Tax)</strong></td><td>Gross Profit - Operating Expenses</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Interest Expense</strong></td><td>Cost of debt (loans, bonds).</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>PBT (Profit Before Tax)</strong></td><td>EBIT - Interest</td></tr>
        <tr><td><strong>Net Profit (PAT)</strong></td><td>PBT - Tax</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h3>2. Projected Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)</h3>
    <p>A snapshot of the project’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time, following the accounting identity: <strong>Assets = Liabilities + Equity</strong>.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Assets:</strong> What the project owns (Fixed Assets, Current Assets).</li>
        <li><strong>Liabilities:</strong> What the project owes to outsiders (Debt, Creditors).</li>
        <li><strong>Equity:</strong> The owners' stake (Share Capital, Retained Earnings).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Projected Cash Flow Statement (CFS)</h3>
    <p>This statement tracks the actual movement of cash (inflows and outflows) during a period, categorized into three sections.</p>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Operating Cash Flow (OCF):</strong> Cash generated from normal business activities (e.g., cash from sales, cash paid for materials).</li>
        <li><strong>Investment Cash Flow (ICF):</strong> Cash used for acquiring or selling long-term assets (e.g., Capital Expenditure on machinery, sale of old assets).</li>
        <li><strong>Financing Cash Flow (FCF):</strong> Cash related to raising funds and paying capital providers (e.g., Loan Receipts, Repayments, Equity Contributions, Dividend Payments).</li>
    </ol>
