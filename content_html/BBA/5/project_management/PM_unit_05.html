    <h1>UNIT 5: Financial Projections</h1>

    <h2>1. COST OF THE PROJECT</h2>
    <p>Project cost is the total expenditure required to implement and operate the project until it reaches commercial production or operational status. It includes all capital and pre-operative expenses.</p>

    <h3>Project Cost Components</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>**Capital Expenditure (CAPEX):** Investment in long-term assets.
            <ul>
                <li>**Fixed Assets:** Land, building, plant & machinery, equipment.</li>
                <li>**Intangible Assets:** Software, patents, licenses, preliminary expenses.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**Working Capital:** Funds needed for day-to-day operations.
            <ul>
                <li>**Net Working Capital** = Current Assets (Raw materials, finished goods, debtors, cash) - Current Liabilities (Creditors, accrued expenses).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**Pre-operative Expenses:** Expenses incurred before commercial operations begin.
            <ul>
                <li>Feasibility studies, legal fees, trial runs, training costs, interest during construction period.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**Contingency (5-10% of total cost):** An allocation for unforeseen expenses, price escalations, or minor design changes.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Cost Estimation Methods</h3>
    <p>Techniques used to predict the cost of a project, varying in accuracy and detail.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>**Analogous Estimation (Top-Down):** Uses data from similar, completed past projects to estimate the current project's cost.
            <ul>
                <li>**Pros:** Quick, used in early stages when information is limited.</li>
                <li>**Cons:** Less accurate due to potential differences between projects.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**Parametric Estimation:** Uses a **statistical relationship** between historical data and other variables (e.g., cost per square foot, cost per line of code) to calculate an estimate.
            <ul>
                <li>**Pros:** Highly accurate if the relationship is reliable and scale is a key factor.</li>
                <li>**Cons:** Requires good historical data and a quantifiable variable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**Bottom-Up Estimation:** The most detailed method, where the cost of individual work packages is estimated and then aggregated to get the total project cost.
            <ul>
                <li>**Pros:** Most accurate and detailed.</li>
                <li>**Cons:** Time-consuming and requires a fully defined Work Breakdown Structure (WBS).</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>2. SOURCES OF FINANCE</h2>
    <p>Financial sources are broadly categorized into internal and external, and equity and debt.</p>

    <h3>Internal Sources</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>**Retained Earnings:** Profits kept in the business rather than paid out as dividends.</li>
        <li>**Sale of Assets:** Disposal of non-core or surplus assets.</li>
        <li>**Depreciation Provision:** Non-cash expense that generates internal funds for replacement.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>External Sources</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>**Equity:** Funds raised by issuing ownership shares.
            <ul>
                <li>**Ordinary Shares/Common Stock:** Permanent capital with voting rights.</li>
                <li>**Preference Shares:** Fixed dividend, priority in repayment, no/limited voting rights.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**Debt:** Borrowed funds that must be repaid with interest.
            <ul>
                <li>**Term Loans:** Long-term funding from commercial banks or financial institutions.</li>
                <li>**Debentures/Bonds:** Secured or unsecured debt instruments issued to the public.</li>
                <li>**Working Capital Finance:** Short-term loans like cash credit, overdraft, or trade credit.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>**Hybrid Finance:** Instruments that combine features of both debt and equity (e.g., convertible debentures, venture capital).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>3. PROJECTED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS</h2>

    <h3>1. Projected Income Statement (Profit & Loss)</h3>
    <p>This statement projects the project's profitability over a period by matching revenues and expenses.</p>
    <table class="data-table">
        <tr><th>Component</th><th>Description</th></tr>
        <tr><td>**Sales Revenue**</td><td>Projected volume × Unit Price</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Cost of Goods Sold (COGS)**</td><td>Direct costs like raw materials, labor, and factory overhead.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Gross Profit**</td><td>Sales Revenue - COGS</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Operating Expenses**</td><td>Selling, General, and Administrative (SG&A) costs.</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**EBIT (Earnings Before Interest & Tax)**</td><td>Gross Profit - Operating Expenses</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Interest Expense**</td><td>Cost of debt (loans, bonds).</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**PBT (Profit Before Tax)**</td><td>EBIT - Interest</td></tr>
        <tr><td>**Net Profit (PAT)**</td><td>PBT - Tax</td></tr>
    </table>

    <h3>2. Projected Balance Sheet (Statement of Financial Position)</h3>
    <p>A snapshot of the project’s assets, liabilities, and equity at a specific point in time, following the accounting identity: **Assets = Liabilities + Equity**.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>**Assets:** What the project owns (Fixed Assets, Current Assets).</li>
        <li>**Liabilities:** What the project owes to outsiders (Debt, Creditors).</li>
        <li>**Equity:** The owners' stake (Share Capital, Retained Earnings).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Projected Cash Flow Statement (CFS)</h3>
    <p>This statement tracks the actual movement of cash (inflows and outflows) during a period, categorized into three sections.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>**Operating Cash Flow (OCF):** Cash generated from normal business activities (e.g., cash from sales, cash paid for materials).</li>
        <li>**Investment Cash Flow (ICF):** Cash used for acquiring or selling long-term assets (e.g., Capital Expenditure on machinery, sale of old assets).</li>
        <li>**Financing Cash Flow (FCF):** Cash related to raising funds and paying capital providers (e.g., Loan Receipts, Repayments, Equity Contributions, Dividend Payments).</li>
    </ol>
